# ask-rust-book

The repository to keep Rust programming practice by self-studying [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

[ASK](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amoghskulkarni/) are just my initials.

# Install

[Follow the instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html) on Rust book's section on installation on different systems.

### Or use [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) instead

Install [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/) and VS Code's [Dev Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension. More installation related instructions are [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

Follow the platform specific instructions for opening a dev container on your machine. On Windows, WSL 2 backend is used by default by Docker desktop.

The Docker daemon should be up and running for using the dev container.
